# Chandler's Lularoe Inventory
### by Benjamin Earl

- Version 1.5
- Last Update 1-6-17

## Setup
- Copy the BenzProgram folder into the same folder that contains all the folders of photos
- Edit the styles.txt file so that it contains all the names of the folders of photos, the output will show which ones it couldn't find
- Also feel free to edit the catagories (the lines that start with a dash) you can put all the styles into one catagory for all I care.
- Only lines that start with a dash or a letter are read, so do anything else to mark something as a comment

## Running
- Open the RunThisOne.cmd file which will open notepad which should have the output
  **OR**
- You can run the inventoryProgram.exe in command prompt and read the output there
